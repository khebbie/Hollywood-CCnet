CCnet Hollywood status (Don't call us we'll call you)

This is meant as an alternative to cctray - which pops up and interupts.
This one you start yourself from your favorite application launcher, when you want the status from ccnet.


Two versions exists:
- A command line 
- A wpf version.

The WPF version needs STA when not run in powershell ISE - thats what the .cmd file does.


Remember to edit the build-servers before running
